# Fish immune cell landscape
We used 10X scRNA-Seq to investigate gene expression dynamics and cell type changes in four turbot immuno-organs (gill, head kidney, posterior intestine and spleen) during infection. In total, 103,055 high quality leukocytes were characterized.

# Raw data of 10X scRNA-Seq
GEO accession number of 10X scRNA-Seq Raw data is GSE174019

# Reference genome
We performed iso-seq to improve the genome annotation with full-length mRNA evidence pooled from leukocytes of spleen and posterior intestine at steady stage and 7-dpi.  
Bioproject number of full-length RNA-seq RAW data on NCBI is PRJNA727669.
